   Derek Muller vs Carol Dweck, or both?
  </h4>
  
  <h6>
   Carol Dweck
  </h6>
  
  <p1>
   Carol Dweck presents the idea of a fixed mindset vs a growth mindset. Initially she just stats the idea that those with a 
   growth mindset are greatly better off in school following grade 7 or the age of 13. The three factors used are the willingness
   to learn, ones effort levels and growing off our deficiencies. Those with a fixed mindset are merely trying not to look dumb in
   front of their peers while one with a growth mindset strive to leanr at all costs. People with a fixed mindset are stated to
   belive that effort comes along with our given abiltites and extra effort is a "tryhard" while one with a growth mindset relizes 
   the only way to succeed is by putting in strenuous effort. The final aspect she talked about was deficiences. A fixed mindset tells
   us to hide from our mistakes as they might show weakness, which also ties back to the not looking dumb idea. Those with a growth 
   mindset look at mistakes as the best way of learning as they show what we need work on and once those skills are devloped we can 
   become masters in that respective field.

   Derek Muller
  </h6>
  
  <p2>
   Derek Muller pressents his ideas through the use of two seperate videos. In the first he just talks about the idea of what makes 
   the mass of a given tree. While some may already know that CO2 makes up the mass that is not really the purpose of this given 
   video at least for our purposes. We focus on how he uses failure and clear terrible answers as a way of teaching others what material 
   is really being presented. While for 3 minutes he makes people look stupid, which he clears up and explains in video 2, in reality
   he is presenting common misconceptions that he then uses to teach that given person the correct answer or whatever is needed. While
   some might see this as him being a jerk in realioty he is using the best form of teaching which is failure.

   Combination of Both
  </h6>
  
  <p3>
   Clearly the overlapping idelogies between the two professors is the idea of using failure as the best way of learning. As long as
   we hold a growth mindset it can be expected that we use the idea presneted in the tree videos. Specificslly taking our deficiencies
   and using them to inspire our learning to new levels and beyonds. It can now be expe ted of us in all our classes that we might 
   relize what we need work on and take that to learn our material at the deepest level.
